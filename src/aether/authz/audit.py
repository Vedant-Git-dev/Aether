"""Append-only, hash-chained audit log.

    entry_hash = sha256(prev_hash || canonical(entry))

Each row commits to the entire history before it, so any edit, deletion,
or reordering is detectable by re-walking the chain with verify_chain() —
the chain check is the tamper evidence, not the database's own grants.

Only non-sensitive metadata is stored (who, what tool, which rule, the
digest of the parameters) — never the parameters themselves.
