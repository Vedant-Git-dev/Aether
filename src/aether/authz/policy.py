"""Deterministic authorization policy — no LLM in the decision path.

Every tool call the model proposes is classified by code and declared rules
before it executes. First match wins:

1. user rules from config.yaml — explicit trust or distrust, a regex on the
   tool name, optionally combined with a regex on the call parameters
2. set_config — personal tuning (agent.*, salience.*, llm.*) -> ALLOW;
   a connect the user just drove in chat (origin "walk" from the /apps
   pick-and-paste — a loop-internal argument the model can never produce)
   on mcp_servers or messaging -> ALLOW, because the user's pick was the
   approval; every other config path (the security sections, an unknown or
   missing one, contacts/authz under any origin) -> REQUIRE_APPROVAL
3. internal Aether tools (memory, scheduling, capture requests) -> ALLOW
4. risky verbs (send, delete, pay, ...) -> REQUIRE_APPROVAL
5. read-only verbs (list, search, get, ...) -> ALLOW
6. anything else -> REQUIRE_APPROVAL

The verb ladders (4 and 5) run against the lowercased tool name: Composio
names its tools UPPER_SNAKE (composio__GMAIL_SEND_EMAIL), and a verb is a
verb in either case — without it every hub tool would park at fail-safe.
A composio tool's name is TOOLKIT_ACTION (gmail is metadata, send_email is
the act), so the hub's tools are classified on the action part alone.

The fail-safe direction matters: an unknown tool can never run silently —
the worst case is an extra approval tap, never an unreviewed action.
