"""The self-restart switch — llm.* config changes apply on a fresh boot,
and nobody should have to restart Aether by hand.

``main()`` serves in a loop: each iteration runs one uvicorn server over a
fresh app instance (fresh lifespan, fresh boot merge), and re-registers it
here before serving. A config change to the llm section calls ``request()``;
a background task waits out the delay — long enough for the current turn to
land its words in chat — then sets the server's ``should_exit``, which starts
uvicorn's graceful shutdown: in-flight requests (websockets included) drain,
the lifespan closes the loop, connectors, host, and pool, and the serve loop
iterates. ``take_pending()`` is what tells the loop to iterate rather than
exit — a real SIGINT/SIGTERM never arms a restart, so it always exits.

When no server is registered (unit tests, the e2e dev fixture) ``request()``
returns False and the change simply applies on the next boot — a restart
request must never crash the process making it. A restart request while one
is already armed is a no-op: one restart in flight, and the fresh boot
re-reads everything anyway.
