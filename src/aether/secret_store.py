"""Keys pasted in chat, kept encrypted — the .env-free half of /apps.

A key pasted in an /apps answer is consumed before ingest (the walk
answers in the deterministic command path — no model, no memory, no
trace), never echoed back (replies name the NAME only), and lands here
with the same AES-256-GCM as all other content, bound to its row through
the cipher's AAD. The resolver reads this store before .env, so a paste
is the most recent deliberate act and wins over an older line — and .env
keeps working for every name that never gets pasted.

The trade-off is stated plainly: the value transits the chat platform
and sits in its history until the user deletes the message. That is the
price of never editing a file on a server; docs advise deleting the sent
message right after the "stored." reply.
