"""Routines — standing event triggers the user teaches once ("when Alice
emails me, note it under billing") and Aether evaluates on every new event.

Matching is deterministic code, never an LLM judgment: a trigger is a small
structured spec — `source`, `kind`, `from`, `contains`, AND-combined, each
optional — so whether a routine fired is explainable from the stored row
alone. The *action* is a plain tool call, and it passes the same
authorization gate at fire time as anything the model proposes: teaching a
routine is never a way around review, only a way to stop re-teaching.

Both the trigger and the action are encrypted at rest like every other
human-readable content. Every fire is recorded in the hash-chained audit
log with its provenance (`rules_matched` = "routine:<id>"), so "why did you
do that?" always has a row to point at.
