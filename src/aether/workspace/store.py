"""Aether's workspace: a small set of human-editable Markdown files that
define who Aether is, how it behaves, durable facts about the user, and
daily working notes — separate from (and much smaller than) the Postgres
event memory, which stays the source of truth for observed history.

    IDENTITY.md  — name, vibe, presentation: who Aether is
    SOUL.md      — personality, tone, behavioral boundaries (never permissions)
    AGENTS.md    — how Aether should use this workspace
    USER.md      — stable user preferences (active until superseded)
    MEMORY.md    — curated durable facts and decisions
    BOOTSTRAP.md — present only until first-run setup is done
    memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md — daily working notes, promoted into MEMORY.md
                           when something turns out to matter

Trade-off, stated like the rest of Aether's: these files are plain text on
disk, not encrypted like the database — the whole point is that a human can
open and edit them directly. Give the workspace directory the same care you
would give any other file holding personal context.

Every entry carries provenance in an inline HTML comment —
`<!-- id:... source:... at:... status:... -->` — so a written fact never
silently turns into an unattributed permanent one, and a preference can be
superseded instead of piling up as a contradiction.

- Most things belong in ordinary event memory, not here — write to this
  workspace sparingly, for what should survive and guide future turns.
