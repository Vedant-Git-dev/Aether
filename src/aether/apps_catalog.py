"""The app catalog: the chat surfaces ship as recipes — links, the key
asks, and the toggle, all plain data.

A recipe is everything the /apps walk needs to connect a chat surface
without the user going looking for any of it: where to click (exact
links, numbered steps), what to paste (one ask per key, by name only —
values are handed over in chat and consumed before ingest), and the
messaging toggle to write. External apps (gmail, github, notion, …) are
NOT here: they connect through Composio, whose own toolkit catalog is
fetched live by the bridge — Aether keeps no per-app list of someone
else's ecosystem. Anything that speaks MCP directly gets the generic
walk ("something else"), whose server fragments reference keys by name
(`$NAME`), expanded at open time by the resolver, so the pinned config
copy never carries a secret value either.
