"""The continuous loop: watch feeds, remember, reason, act — with a human
in the path for anything risky.

One background task. Each tick it (a) fires due MCP source polls (the
user's config.yaml poll_tools — a standing instruction, so these run
directly and are audited), (b) turns inbound chat into memory, (c) scores
everything new for salience, (d) checks the user's standing routines
against the new events — deterministic matching, with the taught action
passing the gate at fire time — and (e) if anything actually happened,
runs one authz-gated LLM turn and fans the reply out to every enabled
surface.

Between ticks it sleeps `agent.tick_seconds`, waking early the moment work
arrives (a message, a screen capture, a wake() from the API).

The executor is the single choke point: every ToolCall the model proposes,
every scheduled action when it fires, and every routine when it triggers,
goes through `classify` → run / park / deny, and lands in the hash-chained
audit log either way. And every act leaves a trace — what triggered it,
what the gate ruled, what came back — so "why did you do that?" always
has a record to answer from.
