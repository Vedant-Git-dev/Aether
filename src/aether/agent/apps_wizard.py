"""The guided /apps walk: connect an app without leaving chat.

Bare /apps is just the status — what's connected and what the gate does
with it. /apps add <name> is the front door: a chat surface (telegram,
discord, slack) hands over its recipe — the exact link, the paste ask —
and every other name is looked up in the app hub's live catalog, exactly
or fuzzily (a fuzzy hit asks which one, numbered). The hub's connect is
a hosted link: Aether asks for the project's COMPOSIO_API_KEY once (the
paste stage, consumed before ingest, encrypted, never echoed), then
serves the app's Connect Link and waits out of band. When the click
lands, the walk's last question is the gate's: what may Aether do with
this app — read freely (the default), everything asks first, or act
freely — and the stricter answers write an authz rule through the same
applier, which parks it for the one-tap because authz is a security
root even from a walk. Nothing matched? The generic MCP walk asks its
standardized questions.

The wizard stays a pure state machine in the ConfigWizard's discipline:
no I/O of its own, nothing ingested, memory-only state, a 15-minute idle
timeout, cancel words from any stage, and a menu answer that's a word or
two at most (anything longer is a changed subject and the walk steps
aside — except a pasted key at `paste`, which is exactly the one long
answer that's wanted). The Connect Link pause (`link_wait`) completes
out of band: the loop's background waiter announces it and moves the
walk to `permissions` itself.
