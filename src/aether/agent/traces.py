"""Decision traces — the encrypted "why" behind every action.

The audit log is the *what*: append-only, hash-chained, parameters kept
as digests so the chain proves what was decided without storing what was
in the call. A trace is the *why*: what triggered the act, what the model
saw and said, how the authorization gate ruled each proposed call, and
what came back. Together they answer "why did you do that?" with a record
instead of a reconstruction.

One row per act, four kinds:
- turn      — one LLM turn: the trigger (messages, observations), every
              gated call with its ruling, the model's own words between
              calls, and its reply
- routine   — one routine fire: the taught trigger, the matching event,
              the call it ran
- scheduled — one scheduled action firing: the label, the call, the result
- carry_out — an approved call running: the approval, the result

Traces are encrypted at rest like all human-readable content, and they
are bookkeeping, not decisions: writing one must never break the act it
records, so the loop wraps every trace write in its own try/except.
