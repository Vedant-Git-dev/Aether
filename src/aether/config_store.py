"""The durable side of chat-made configuration: everything config.yaml
holds, readable and changeable from chat, with the change outliving the
boot.

On Render's free tier the filesystem is ephemeral — config.yaml is wiped
on every deploy — so a change made from chat has to live in Postgres or it
never happened. One row per setting path in ``config_overrides``, the value
encrypted and bound to its path through the cipher's AAD (an MCP transport
block can carry env secrets; a blob must never be swappable between rows).

``ConfigManager`` is the one interpretation of those rows, shared by both
entry points — the ``/config`` command and the ``set_config`` tool — so the
two can never drift. It never replaces section objects (Salience and the
EventStore hold references to them): it validates first, then mutates
fields and list contents in place. The yaml file (or pydantic defaults,
where no file exists) stays the base: rows merge on top of it at boot, and
reset deletes the row and falls back.

Live-apply per section: personal tuning just takes effect (its consumers
read config on every use), quiet hours reparse, the authz gate and the
approval window rebuild, messaging and mcp server sets diff their live
connections, and llm changes ask the process to restart itself — nobody
restarts Aether by hand. An unwired ref logs and continues: persistence is
still correct, and the next boot merges the same rows.
