"""The guided /apps walk — the state machine alone, with fake callbacks.

These pin the transcripts from the design (they are the spec): bare
/apps is the status and the add hint, /apps add <name> resolves a chat
surface's recipe first, then the app hub's live catalog (exact, fuzzy
with a numbered pick, or nothing → the generic walk offered); the hub's
connect is a one-time COMPOSIO_API_KEY paste and then a hosted link,
waited out of band; and the walk's last question is the gate's — what
the app may do — with the stricter answers writing an authz rule
through the same applier, origin "walk" and all. No recorded reply ever
carries a value: the save double takes it, and every transcript asserts
names only. The gate's half — that "walk" really does allow through the
real policy — lives in test_agent_loop.
